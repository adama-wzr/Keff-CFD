Effective thermal conductivity estimation in binary discretized systems in 2D and 3D.

Current model ignores radiation and convection, only first order thermal conduction effects are considered. The CFD algorithm calculates the steady-state temperature profile of the given input structure, and from the temperature map the heat fluxes can be calculated and the effective property derived. More information in the documentation pdf's.
